# Weather Data Visualization Project


## Description

This project is a web-based weather data visualization tool that allows you to explore temperature and humidity trends over time. It uses Chart.js to create interactive line charts for easy data analysis.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the project [here]

## Features

- Real-time weather data
- Interactive line chart for tracking temperature and humidity trends
- Accurate representation of temperature in degrees Celsius (Â°C) and humidity in percentage (%)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Web browser
- Internet connection

### Installation

No installation is required for this web-based tool. Simply open it in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the [live demo](link_to_demo_if_available) or host the project on your own web server.
2. Enter the name of the city you want to explore the weather data for.
3. Click the "Search" button to display the current weather and 7-day forecast.
4. Explore the temperature and humidity trends over the 5-day period in the interactive chart.
5. Enjoy visualizing the weather data!

## Understanding the <i>Code</i>

The two main things I used in this project are an API key from OpenWeatherApp and a chart.js library. 

### Obtaining an API Key

To use this project, you'll need to obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherApp](https://openweathermap.org/api). Follow these steps to obtain your API key:

1. Visit [OpenWeatherApp API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and sign up for an account if you don't have one.
2. Once logged in, navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new API key.
3. Copy the generated API key and replace it in the project's code where specified i.e., 'YOUR_API

### Using Chart.js

- Chart.js is a JavaScript library used in this project to create interactive line charts and bar graphs. 
- It's an open-source library that provides a simple and flexible way to add charting capabilities to your web application. 
- I chose Chart.js because of its ease of use and powerful features for visualizing data trends.
- Read the documentation of the chart.js to understand it better.
